# Number-of-pairs

An array of size S and a number N. counting the number of pairs in the array whose sum is equal to N

The input should consist 2 lines. The first line contains 2 numbers, S(1 ≤ S ≤ 100000) and N( - 100000 ≤ N ≤ 100000) respectively. 
The second line contains S numbers ( - 100000 ≤ number ≤ 100000) which represent the contents of the array.

Output
The output is the number of pairs in the array whose sum is equal to N.
